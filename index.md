# Welcome to my page

My name is **Stacy Ikechukwu Jr. Aneke**. I am a 22 year-old 1st-generation Nigerian American who just recently graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.A. in Linguistics & Psychology. I am an Igbo boy who loves my culture and who is currently trying to make the big transition into adulthood with my pursuit of a post-graduate degree in Clinical and Mental Health Counseling at Regent University. My relationship with God is very important to me and I love any conversations about any faith-based topics, but specifically Christianity because they allow me to feel a sense of spiritual connection and growth I don't get in many other places.<br/>
In my free time I love to watch anime and Youtube videos. I love meeting up with friends and Freestyling to whatever beats we can find (this was especially the case before Covid). I love to try new activities especially in regards to eating or traveling, and I enjoy getting lost in the moments that I spend with the people I care about.<br/>

## Why TKH

To explain why I'm interested in becoming a TKH innovation fellow, I must start by explaining my passions. Growing up I've always loved electronics whether it be new game systems, new technology like MP3 players or laptops, or even things as simple as the as seen on TV items. I loved being able to follow the up-to-date news on games especially and I remember looking at Game Informer magazines to see all the cool new specs for the Nintendo 3DS. I would be using multiple different MP3 players and be interested in how video cameras worked. Even with this going on in the background I was unsure about what I wanted major in once I got into college. It was only once I was shown a glimpse of what occured in Cyber Security that I realized that something involving computer science sounded like something I would be truly interested in. Flash foward into my second year of trying to become a Mathematics and Computations major and I realized the heavy math compnent was not exactly what I was looking for and I ended up getting advice to switch to some psychology major. After switching into Linguistics & Psychology I realized that I do have a strong passion for helping people and I would like to be another Black male counselor for people (especially ones that look like me)to rely on.<br/>
After thinking about things and hearing about this fellowship from my mentor I felt like it would be a way for me to come back to computing in some senses, which was exciting because those were classes that I enjoyed while in my past major. I also see this as an opportunity to be another asset making mental health knowledge and facts more accessible while promoting the destigmatization of mental health especially in communities of color.
